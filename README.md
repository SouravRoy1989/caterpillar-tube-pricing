Notes for the CAT Kaggle competition


To get an idea what the cost function looks like and how it penalizes error, plot log(x) wherex = p_i/a_i, p_i = predicted price, a_i = actual price.

Stopped using comp variables - but there may be some that are useful. Most common ones are: 
orientation: # occurrences: 10
weight: # occurrences: 11
bolt_pattern_wide: # occurrences: 5
overall_length: # occurrences: 5
unique_feature: # occurrences: 7
bolt_pattern_long: # occurrences: 5
thickness: # occurrences: 4
groove: # occurrences: 4
